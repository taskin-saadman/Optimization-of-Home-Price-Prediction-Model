# Optimization-of-Home-Price-Prediction-Model
A Python-based implementation of a machine learning pipeline to predict home prices using the Decision Tree Regressor. The model is optimized by identifying the best tree size (maximum leaf nodes) that minimizes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on validation data.
